# DHT11 Sensor Configuration

# GPIO pin number (BCM numbering)
# Common pins:
#   GPIO 4  = Physical pin 7
#   GPIO 17 = Physical pin 11
#   GPIO 27 = Physical pin 13
gpio_pin: 4

# Sensor type: DHT11 or DHT22 (also known as AM2302)
# DHT22 is more accurate and reliable
# - DHT11: 0-50°C (±2°C), 20-90% RH (±5%)
# - DHT22: -40-80°C (±0.5°C), 0-100% RH (±2%)
sensor_type: "DHT11"  # Change to "DHT22" if using DHT22/AM2302

# Reading interval in seconds
read_interval: 2

# Temperature unit: "C" or "F"
temperature_unit: "C"

# Display both units
show_both_units: true
